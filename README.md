Hey you! Welcome to Airline Routes ✈️!

Built with React, Airline Routes allows for efficient DOM manipulation all within a single page application. This, in turn, allows a beautiful map with accurate latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates to be displayed, that get updated instantaneously with every filtering and page change.

Give it a try! Change routes and check to see what the map looks like 🙂👍
